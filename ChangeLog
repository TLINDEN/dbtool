1.9:
	- rewrote configure, it better finds berkeley
	  db or gdbm.
	- put the source on github.

1.8:
	- configure didn't take existing $LDFLAGS, $CPPFLAGS
	  into account.
1.7:
	- applied freebsd port patches
	- applied openpkg source patches
	- made default_db a const char
	- fixed configure.in variable bug

1.6:
	- applied patch by Thierry Thomas <thierry@pompo.net> which
	  makes the code gcc 3.2 compliant (with some additional changes
	  made by me).
	- changed the header of all sourcefiles.

1.5:
	- added using namespace std to enable gcc 3.0 to work
	- renamed Engine::stdin() to Engine::from_stdin() because
	  stdin is a symbol used by C (the *FILE handle for STDIN).
	- added -g and -O compilerflags to configure.in
1.4:
        - added encryption support (which was planned since a long time)
	  using rijndael cipher. The rijndael code was not written by me,
	  see rijndael.h for more details.
	- added digest.h + digest.cc from the common-c++ library. I
	  modified it a little bit to suite my needs. Using the whole
	  library was too much overhead IMHO.
	- the cipher class is just a wrapper around the rijndael+digest
	  classes.
	- source code re-organised. Every .cc file has it's corresponding
	  .h file. The Config class is now in config.h, the Engine
	  class has it's own engine.h header. dbtool.h contains now
	  only global stuff, no class definitions. main.cc has been
	  renamed to dbtool.cc.
	- fixed bug in configure.in (which I found in the FreeBSD
	  port of dbtool. It contains a patch to fix this)
	- added -R feature to -S, -s and -D too
	- added sample shell scripts showing the capabilities of dbtool (locate)
	- manpage updated and usage string too

1.3:
        - moved the pcre_compile calls outa the
	  while() loops, be more efficient, thanks to Robert <robert@ilse.nl> :-)
	- fixed a bug in the pcre_exec call, there was "key.length() + 1" which
	  caused pcre to search through the whole C-string including the terminating \0
	  , in fact if a key ended with the character "B" then the following expression
	  did not match: ".*B$" because the last character in the string was the \0, not the "B".
	- files are now only opened readonly if one use -s, -S or -D

1.2:
	- added regexp support and dump mode

1.1:
	- moved to autoconf/automake

1.0:
	- initial version
