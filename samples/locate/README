just an example showing what's possible 
with dbtool. These two shell scripts
are doing the same job as GNU locate.

  updatedb
    creates a database which contains
    every file (with path) of a system
    along with all it's attributes.

  locate
    searches in this database using
    user supplied regular expressions

You need to edit both scripts to suit
your system.
